# world_seed

The site's canonical bring-up. **One command**, repeatable, no
post-install ceremony:

```bash
ddev drush en world_seed -y
```

That's it. After that command settles, the world is in its canonical
demo state: admin user (uid=1), six authors with bios + writing
themes, five sector taxonomy terms, 100 articles, 15 events, 15
biographies, plus Spanish translations of all content and an embed
pass for the corpus. If the gateway is unreachable the embed step is
skipped with a notice and `drush world:embed` picks it up later.

## Re-running

```bash
# Re-seed in place (purges only marker-stamped seeded entities,
# leaves manually-authored content alone):
ddev drush world:seed

# Full reset (uninstall removes the seeded fields via enforced
# dependencies; reinstall lands them again clean):
ddev drush pmu world_seed -y && ddev drush en world_seed -y
```

## What ships

- **Admin user** (`uid=1`, username `admin`) — created with a generated
  password printed once on first install. Re-running the seed leaves
  uid=1 alone.
- **6 authors** with bio + writing themes — `mcervantes`, `jruvalcaba`,
  `lbermudez`, `dpavon`, `ctorresvega`, `afonseca`.
- **5 sector taxonomy terms** in the `topics` vocabulary — Antigua,
  Cauca, Boquete, Sierra Madre, Tarrazú.
- **100 article nodes**, distributed across the authors and sectors
  (20 per sector; mix of authors per sector).
- **15 events** — harvests, cupping competitions, conferences.
- **15 biographies** as `profile` nodes (real coffee figures — producers,
  agronomists, mill operators).

Events and profiles are owned by `uid=1`. Articles are owned by their
author. The rationale: per the project's editorial model, **authors
write opinion + reportage** (articles), and **events / biographies
are factual descriptions of the world**, not someone's byline.

## Idempotence

Both `hook_install` and `drush world:seed` are idempotent: they
purge entities previously stamped with the seed marker (a
`world_seed.seed_state` Drupal state key tracks UUIDs) and recreate
them from `data/*.json`. Manually-authored content with overlapping
titles is **not** touched — the purge keys on UUID, never on title.

```bash
# Fresh install (or re-seed)
ddev drush en world_seed
# or, if already enabled:
ddev drush world:seed

# Clear only the seeded entities
ddev drush world:seed:purge
```

After seeding the install hook also fires a `world:embed` pass. If
the gateway isn't reachable that step is skipped with a warning;
run `drush world:embed` later.

## Atlas Vector Search index

`WorldSearchClient::nearest()` (added in this slice) projects an
entity's embedding against the corpus to find semantically-similar
documents. It depends on an Atlas Vector Search index. Atlas index
creation is out-of-band — Atlas Admin API or the Atlas UI — but the
spec is fixed.

### Index spec

Database: `drupal_three_js_theme_world` (or whatever
`WORLD_SIGNATURE_DATABASE` resolves to in `.ddev/config.yaml` ->
`web_environment`).

Collection: `descriptors`.

Index name: `world_embeddings` (override via `WORLD_VECTOR_INDEX`
env var if you need a different name).

JSON definition (paste into Atlas → Search → Create Search Index →
JSON editor):

```json
{
  "fields": [
    {
      "type": "vector",
      "path": "signature.semantic.embedding",
      "numDimensions": 256,
      "similarity": "cosine"
    },
    {
      "type": "filter",
      "path": "bundle"
    },
    {
      "type": "filter",
      "path": "sector"
    }
  ]
}
```

Notes:

- `numDimensions: 256` matches the dev TF-IDF provider. When you
  flip `WORLD_EMBED_URL` to a neural provider with a different output
  dimension (1536 for OpenAI, 1024 for Voyage `voyage-3`, etc.),
  recreate the index with the new value. Mismatched dimensions are
  a `$vectorSearch` runtime error.
- `similarity: cosine` matches what the in-client projector and the
  pole-axis computation use. Don't change to euclidean / dotProduct
  without updating both ends.
- The `filter` fields enable combined queries like "nearest
  *articles* (bundle=article) within the *cauca* sector." Add more
  filter paths as needed; each filter field has Atlas-side index
  overhead.

### Verifying the index is live

```bash
# Pick any descriptor id from your snapshot, then:
ddev drush php:eval "
\$client = \Drupal::service('world_signature.world_search_client');
\$desc = \$client->find('node:article:12');
\$vec  = \$desc['signature']['semantic']['embedding'] ?? null;
print_r(\$client->nearest(\$vec, 5, ['bundle' => 'article']));
"
```

You should get a 5-element array sorted by `score` descending. If
the index isn't there, `nearest()` returns `[]` and logs a warning
(it doesn't throw — callers can fall back).

## Why this module exists

The previous bring-up was a `drush scr scaffold/seed-atlas-coffee.php`
script — a one-shot fixture loader. This module replaces it with a
real Drupal artifact: dependency-injected, drush-command-driven,
idempotent, and with an explicit purge path.

The seed data lives in JSON files under `data/` so a property build
can fork the module, edit the JSON, and have a different world.
That's the seed pattern — content is data, not code.
